The submission for this project includes following code files
1. indicators.py
2. TheoreticallyOptimalStrategy.py
3. testproject.py

Given below are the instructions to run each part of the code
1) In order generator Part 1 output (indicator output), run the command <<python indicators.py>> in the directlry using command line. The code will generate appropriate indicator charts.

2) In order generator Part 2 output (TheoreticallyOptimalStrategy output), run the command <<python TheoreticallyOptimalStrategy.py>> in the directlry using command line. The code will generate    appropriate graphs and print the statistics for the Optimal Strategy.

3) Both Part 1 and Part 2 can be run together simultaneously using the code <<python testproject.py>>. This will generate the charts of Part 1 and Part 2 and also print the statistics for the Optimal Strategy.


Note: The marketsimcode.py file is not submitted because, the functionality (compute_portvals) coded in this file has been subsumed in TheoreticallyOptimalStrategy.py file.
